Genes4all Curate, visualization module for Curating -omic data in Chado
=======================================================================

* This module, like the rest of genes4all, begun as an offshoot of est2assembly. Therefore some methods are derived from there 
 (if a volunteer wishes to help, we can remove this dependency!).
* To load the EC (enzyme classification) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) we need to use est2assembly's create_ec-kegg_cv.pl.
  This requires annot8r installed or an annot8r database (derived from est2assembly's project page)
