SSAHA2 makes and saves hash tables with preconfigured kmer counts.
In order to use it for DBSF you must produce the hash tables first
as per the documentation in the dbsf_ssaha2.inc file. Please follow 
the instructions there which I'm going to copy paste here again:

 * A SSAHA dataset must have the following to be allowed
 * 1) The actual raw fasta file (eg dmel_genome_5.16 for these instructions)
 * 2) formatted with index_fasta.pl (in scripts; a BioPerl script)
 *    e.g. index_fasta.pl -d dmel_genome_5.16
 * 3) hash table build with the ssaha2Build -rtype abi as -save dmel_genome_5.16_sanger
 * 4) hash table build with the ssaha2Build -rtype 454 as -save dmel_genome_5.16_454
 * 5) hash table build with the ssaha2Build -rtype solexa as -save dmel_genome_5.16_solexa
 * 6) ALL the *.head files produced by ssaha2Build MUST be compressed; use gzip -1 as it is fast.
 * so that for a dataset 'dmel' we have the files
 * - dmel, dmel.index
 * - dmel_sanger.base,dmel_sanger.body,dmel_sanger.head.gz,dmel_sanger.name,dmel_sanger.size
 * - dmel_454.base,dmel_454.body,dmel_454.head.gz,dmel_454.name,dmel_454.size,
 * - dmel_solexa.basedmel_solexa.body,dmel_solexa.head.gz,dmel_solexa.name,dmel_solexa.size
 * Symbolic links are also allowed but must be set in your Apache configuration file as allowed ("follow symlinks" etc)
 * NB The run-user of dbsf_daemon.pl must have permission to write in the directory where the .head.gz file resides
