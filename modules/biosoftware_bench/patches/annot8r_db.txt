Your annot8r databases must allow SELECT for the user you setup in the administration form
So if you have given the user to be an unpriviliged www-db then you need to go to each psql 
database and give SELECT permissions in every table. Here is a function that can do that for
 the connected database.


a8r_gobase=# 
CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql ;

a8r_gobase=#  
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pg_grant(TEXT, TEXT)
RETURNS integer AS '
DECLARE obj record;
num integer;
BEGIN
num:=0;
FOR obj IN SELECT relname FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace ns ON (c.relnamespace = ns.oid) WHERE
relkind in (''r'',''v'',''S'') AND
nspname = ''public'' AND
relname LIKE ''%''
LOOP
EXECUTE ''GRANT '' || $2 || '' ON '' || obj.relname || '' TO '' || $1;
num := num + 1;
END LOOP;
RETURN num;
END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql ;

a8r_gobase=#  
select pg_grant('"www-db"','select');

Just do this in every a8r database
